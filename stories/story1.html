  <h1>The Rainbow who ate everything</h1>
<body><a href="/">Katelyn's Homepage</a><br>
    <p>Once opon a time there was a rainbow. You might think that this is a peaceful story but the rainbow atually eats land.<br>
      He can eat a whole forest in 1 day! He can drink a whole ocean in 1 day! His favorite piece of land is grass. He did not know <br>
      that he was eating birds homes. He did not know that he was drinking the peoples water. The people and animals tried to stop him <br>
      but he would'nt listen to them. Soon he started to eat the colors too! He was changing colors! He ate to much of everything that <br>
      he spit everything out. Everything was back to normal. The End.
