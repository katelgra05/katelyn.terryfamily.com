  <h1>Hard days at school</h1>
  <a href="/">Katelyn's Homepage</a><br>
<p>Once opon a time there was a girl named Sarah. She didn't want to go to school today. She didn't want to deal with all of <br>
her classmates that always kept teasing her. "Mom, I don't want to go to school today." Sarah called. "Why? Its such a nice day?" <br>
Mom asked."My classmates have been teasing me lately because they are jealous about me being the top of the class." Sarah answered.<br>
"Well, you better get to school. Its starting soon." Her mom warned her. Sarah headed out the door and called goodbye to her mother.<br>
She braced herself for the loud, noisy bus that she was walking into. Just as Sarah had predicted the bus was as loud as usual.<br>
Sarah dreaded the long walk from the school entrence to her classroom. Her classroom was at the very back of the school.<br>
