<a href="/">Katelyn's Homepage</a>
    <p>Sugar is deadly if you eat too much of it. It can give you diabetes, heart disease, any kind of cancer, and lots of other things that can kill you.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some other things that might happen to you if you eat too much sugar.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Weight gain</li>
      <li>Skin aging</li>
      <li>Cellular aging</li>
      <li>Alzheimer's disease</li>
      <li>Acne</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And a lot more.</p>

    <p>Sugar will also give you high blood pressure and make your organs fat. Two people were tested and told that they were close to diabetes. They changed their diet and looked at the back of cans and cereal boxes and threw away the ones with too much sugar. After a while they were tested again and found out that they were far away from diabetes.</p>
